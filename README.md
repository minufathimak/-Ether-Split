🪙 Payment Splitter DApp
A decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows groups of friends to easily track and split shared expenses in a transparent and trustless manner.

📖 About The Project
This project is a Web3 implementation of a classic expense-splitting application, similar to Splitwise or Tricount. Instead of relying on a centralized server, it leverages a Solidity smart contract to manage groups, log expenses, and calculate balances. This ensures that the financial ledger is immutable, transparent, and completely controlled by the users, not a company.
Users can create a group, add friends, log expenses specifying who paid and how the cost is split, and instantly see real-time balances of who owes whom. The entire application is powered by the Ethereum blockchain, with a user-friendly interface built in React.js.
✨ Key Features
👥 Decentralized Group Management: Create a group and add friends by their names or addresses.
💸 Expense Tracking: Log new expenses with a description, amount, and the payer.
🧮 Automated Balance Calculation: The smart contract automatically calculates and updates what each person owes or is owed in real-time.
🔗 On-Chain Transparency: All transactions and expense logs are recorded on the blockchain, creating a single, verifiable source of truth for all group members.
🌐 User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive UI built with React.js makes interacting with the blockchain simple.
🦊 MetaMask Integration: Easily connect your Web3 wallet to interact with the DApp.
